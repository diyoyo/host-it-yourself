# Goals

- Testing the implementation of simple features that do not require core [TriliumNext-Note](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Notes) modifications, such as :
    - Templates
    - scripts
    - Themes
    - General note architecture
    - simple workarounds

- Showing it off in [TriliumNext/Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/TriliumNext/discussions/categories/show-and-tell) threads (and/or getting feedback on features that are actually reinventing the wheel)

- Getting feedback on potentially dangerous features that could expose HIYers to security issues.
